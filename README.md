When a user clicks the "Generate Password" button, he or she is prompted to enter a password length of 8 to 128 characters, and given a choice series of choices of whether or not to include the following character types in the password string:
* Special characters
* Numbers
* Uppercase letters
* Lowercase letters

The user must enter a valid password length and select at least one character type, or will otherwise be re-prompted until doing so. After the user correctly submits their input, a resulting password string satisfying all these criteria will appear in the textarea box. Only once a password has been generated in this way. clicking the "Copy to Clipboard" button will then copy the generated password to the user's clipboard.
